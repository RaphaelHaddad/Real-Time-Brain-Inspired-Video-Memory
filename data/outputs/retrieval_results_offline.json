The person then closes the glass door of the scale, which is a common practice to achieve a stable reading (score: 0.838) [time: 00:54-00:59]\n  4. . The surrounding area is organized with various lab supplies, including a bottle with a red cap, a roll of aluminum foil, a pen, and some papers (score: 0.838) [time: 00:54-00:59]\n  5. . The background shows a fire extinguisher and a sign indicating the location of the fire extinguisher, emphasizing safety protocols (score: 0.838) [time: 00:54-00:59]\n\nRelated Entities (41):\n  1.
